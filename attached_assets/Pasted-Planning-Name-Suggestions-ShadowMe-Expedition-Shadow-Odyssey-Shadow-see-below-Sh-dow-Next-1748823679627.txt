Polishing the Idea
Ideating the Idea
“Sayings” we could use:
“Exploring the job market, recruiting for the future”
First part is for those looking for a job-shadow opportunity, the second part is for the niche businesses themselves
“Where ‘a job’ becomes an adventure”
“Your passion is our prospect”

“Abstract” ideas:
To the student:
[Insert name] is an app that facilitates job searching while gaining industry experience. Rather than competing for a month-long internship at a big brand company that you just want to explore, [insert name] connects you with 1-2 week, unique shadowing opportunities. A job should be more than a way to save for retirement. There is rewarding work out there that is right for you, and we at [insert name] are here to help! With how diverse the job market is, a general search may leave you wondering if your dream career even exists. You may not see these job titles on the “top paying jobs” list, but our goal at [insert name] is for you to find your fit where you can contribute to society in a fun and rewarding way with your salary feeling like a bonus. This short term shadowing opportunity allows for frequent, rapid exploration of your skills, talents, and interests. Rather than one internship that can take up your entire summer, there is the possibility of trying three, maybe even more, jobs in the same span of time. There is more to life than making money and paying bills. There is a place in the market for you, and we at [insert name] want to help you get there. 
To the business offering the shadow
[Insert name] endeavors to foster curiosity for your business. Your business may be what sparks someone’s passion. We at [insert name] understand that not everything can be learned in a classroom. Your business can be the very experience that someone needs to realize their potential in the marketplace. Opening your doors to the curious will not only help others find their dream job, but also help you find your dream employees. Coming from the perspective of curiosity rather than a cold interview for a job from the start can help you and your shadow get to know if this could be that future employee that your business needs. There’s also nothing like a word of mouth recommendation. One shadow may not plan to proceed in your business’s industry, but that shadow can recruit others who can then recruit others. The possibilities are endless!

Ideas for business offering 
With job shadowing include things like certifications for certain industries 
Use government grants that are in place that allow businesses to receive money that aim to help individuals gain skills and credentials to enter or advance in their careers
Find industries where careers are stagnant, in decline, or not seen enough growth
The data collected from user applications can be then used with schools, businesses, and local governments about future career and industry interest
Have schools, business, and local governments pay.

Overall title: Opportunity and Market Overview - Favian

Distinctive Benefits - Falon and Ashlie
For students: exploration of niche jobs, fosters curiosity, more room for “trial and error” for interests/skills, networking opportunities, can try multiple different industries in a short period of time, (for high school aged students) can help determine college major or (for college students) modify/change major, encourages experimentation (act, learn, REFLECT, repeat)
For businesses: more publicity, employee “interview” (less need for references?), word of mouth recognition, less paperwork with short term “shadow,” not as long of a “commitment” as month-ish long internship, faster planning and execution, current employees don’t have to designate as much time to shadows than to interns

Channels of Delivery/Marketing - Enrique
Some channels of marketing that we will utilize to reach our target audience are Social Media platforms, local advertising, small-scale events and informational sessions. Our initial and main form of channel for delivery will be the startup website and a mobile app (later stage). University partnerships and online job boards will be used to attract users and employers. For our awareness channels, we will integrate peer ambassadors and influencers to attract a larger audience, emphasizing the participation from different campuses to cater to our target audience. We can create blog content to suit viewers and engage in SEO to optimize blog articles. These channels will be relatively low in cost to operate in and can gain mass traction.

Competitive Landscape - Enrique
There are several competitors within our market sector that present a high barrier of entry for our target audience. Handshake targets the same audience with internships and job listings. WayUp emphasizes early career roles and DEI-focused employers. Indeed is an early career filter platform and is an indirect competition due to its scale and reach. LinkedIn contains student profiles and is widely used by students for resumes, branding, and connections. Our indirect competitors would be Coursera, Skillshare, and Tallo for skill-building practices that present certificates or career discovery for early professionals.21
